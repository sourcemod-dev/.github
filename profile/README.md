## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Organization for sourcemod.dev website.

👩‍💻 All libraries are located in the [manifest](https://github.com/sourcemod-dev/manifest) repository, PRs are welcome to add additional third-party libraries.

🧙 Support me via [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/rumblefrog) to allow me to work on this and other projects more.


<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
